## Description

Get2gether is a user-friendly web application designed to simplify event planning and social gatherings, alleviating the stress that often accompanies these tasks. Upon visiting the platform, users are seamlessly directed to a signup or login page. Registering is a breeze, requiring only a name, email, and password. Once logged in, users are led to their personal dashboard.

Within the personal dashboard, a plethora of functionalities awaits. Users can effortlessly view all the groups they're part of, their friends, and the events associated with their groups. Creating a new group is a cinch, and it promptly appears in the menu dropdown on the left under "My Groups". Users can then access the group dashboard with a simple click.

In the group dashboard, users can easily add members to their group by clicking the "Add Group Member" button. A modal window with a user-friendly form provides a dropdown for selecting additional members. When a new member is added to a group, they automatically become friends with the existing group members. Removing a group member is just as straightforward; it can be accomplished by accessing the menu on the left, navigating to "Other Group Members," and clicking the broken heart icon next to the member's name. However, only the group admin has access to this feature.

Furthermore, users have the capability to create events for their groups by clicking the "Create Event" button. This action triggers a modal with a user-friendly event creation form. Once the event details are filled in, an event card is generated on the group dashboard and is also visible in the personal dashboard. The event card provides the option to respond to the event with "Going," "Maybe," or "Not Going." Clicking on the event card opens another modal displaying comprehensive event details, including the address, attendees list and response statuses for each attendee.

Our application also boasts a built-in group chat feature directly within the group dashboard, allowing users to instantly communicate with friends and make plans more effortlessly than ever before.
